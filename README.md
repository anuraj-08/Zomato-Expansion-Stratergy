# Zomato-Expansion-Stratergy

Zomato, one of the leading online restaurant discovery and food delivery platforms, has expanded its operations across multiple countries, offering customers a wide variety of dining and delivery options. With this rapid global expansion, it has become essential to analyze restaurant data to understand customer preferences, market performance, and regional trends across different countries.

The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive data analysis using Microsoft Excel to uncover insights from Zomato’s restaurant dataset. The analysis focuses on:

Identifying key factors that influence restaurant ratings and popularity

Comparing restaurant trends across countries and cities

Studying the impact of online delivery, price range, and cuisine type on customer engagement

Recognizing high-growth markets and potential areas for business expansion

Providing data-driven recommendations to enhance Zomato’s global strategy

By cleaning, organizing, and visualizing the data in Excel, this project transforms raw restaurant records into actionable insights — supporting strategic decision-making for Zomato’s international growth and market optimization.
